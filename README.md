# REST Countries Explorer

## The Challenge

The goal of this project was to build out a multi-page country explorer using the REST Countries API, supporting light/dark mode and responsive layouts across devices.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on device screen size
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Search for a country by name
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to view detailed information
- View bordering countries and click to navigate to them

## Built With

- Vue 3 Composition API
- Tailwind CSS

## Technical Features

- **Routing with Vue Router**: Seamless navigation between the home page and individual country detail pages.

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to adapt beautifully across screen sizes.
- **Theme Toggle**: Light and dark mode support using class-based theming.
